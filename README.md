# interactive-card-details-form
This is my second challenge from Frontend Mentor.
I took it up because it looked interesting to do, which it is!
One thing I learnt from this is to always look at all the files. This is because I spent so much time trying to make the gradients of some elements in CSS, only for me to realise only after I had finished the gradients that there was image for it all along.
Currently have not done the javascript necessary, and only the mobile version is available right now.
